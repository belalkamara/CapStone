# Capstone Application

> This application will be a website that allows users to input their running/biking data. Once the user input their data they can filter how broad they want to see where theyâ€™re ranked i.e: Country, Region, State, City, Age Group, Zip Code, and/or private/public groups. Overall the idea that I have with this is to make a running/biking community for the web, with a little friendly competition.

### Features 

- "Friend" function which allows you to see how another user is compared to you
- Blog for users to give advice, Show Off,etc
- Function to allow user to set up public/private events or groups
- Event function to see current events users can join for a challenge
- For events it will show 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place users 
-- In the user's profile there will be medal icons under the users name to display how mant events they won
-- Once they click on the medal they can look at the past Data of the event
